# weatherly-Real-Time-Weather-Dashboard
🌦️ Transforming raw data into real-time insights — 🌍Weatherly!

As part of my internship journey with Elevvo Pathways, I built a Real-Time Weather Dashboard powered by the OpenWeatherMap API, focusing on a clean and minimal user experience.

✨ Core Features:

🌍 Multi-city weather tracking → Displays real-time data for multiple cities.

🌡️ Dynamic weather details → Temperature, condition, and weather icons.

📅 7-day forecast → Helps users plan ahead.

🔍 Search functionality → Instantly fetch weather data for any location.

⏳ Loading states → Smooth user experience during data fetch.

💻 Responsive design → Optimized for desktop & mobile screens.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

 HTML | CSS | JavaScript | OpenWeatherMap API | Fetch

➡️ This project strengthened my expertise in API integration, asynchronous operations, dynamic rendering, and DOM manipulation, while also focusing on delivering a user-friendly, minimal UI. Proud to mark this as Task 7 in my internship journey at Elevvo Pathways🚀
